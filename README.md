# PCLocator

PCLocator is a Java tool that analyzes presence conditions in variable software
systems written in the programming language C.

A presence condition describes under which circumstances a file or block of code
is included in the compiled product. A naive, but slow solution is enumerating
all possible configurations of the software.

There are better tools available to analyze variability in C. PCLocator
integrates the following tools:

- [TypeChef](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef) and
  [xtc](https://github.com/paulgazz/xtc), variability-aware C parsers
- [FeatureCoPP](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001876), a tool for physical
  separation of annotated features that includes a cpp parser
- [Kmax](https://github.com/paulgazz/kmax), a variability-aware analyzer
  Kconfig/Kbuild Makefiles

This tool addresses [this challenge
case](https://github.com/paulgazz/splc18challengecase) of the SPLC 2018
Challenge Track.

## Getting started

The easiest way to set up PCLocator is to download a prepared JAR distribution
here (*TODO*).

To build from source, additionally to cloning the repository, you need to
download the libraries here (*TODO*) and copy them to the `lib` folder. Generate
the output jar from IntelliJ using `Build > Build Artifacts...` and run
`scripts/post_build.sh`.

## Usage

PCLocator requires Java 1.8. Run it with:

```
java -jar PCLocator.jar <arguments>
```

If you don't provide any arguments, detailed usage information will be printed.

## Virtual Machine

PCLocator comes with a virtual machine for reproducible results. (It does not
have to be used though.) To use it, install
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). The JAR distribution ships with a
`Vagrantfile`, so just run `vagrant up` while in the distribution folder. You
will be prompted to install the `hashicorp/precise64` box, a Ubuntu VM. As
provider, we used VirtualBox.

When the VM is running, use `vagrant ssh` to enter a shell. To set up PCLocator
and its dependencies (notably Java), run:

```
cd PCLocator
./setup.sh
```

After accepting the Java License Agreement, PCLocator can be used as described
in this README. (Maybe consider adjusting the RAM size `vb.memory` in
the `Vagrantfile`, then run `vagrant reload`.)

### Examples

#### Presence condition

Extract a single presence condition for the line `<line>` in a C file `<file>`
(using the default parser, a combination of the tools above):

```
java -jar PCLocator.jar <file>:<line>
```

Leave off the `<line>` to get a tabular overview of all presence conditions
using all parsers.

To account for platform-specific macro usage, it is suggested to generate a
platform header file with `echo - | gcc -dM - -E -std=gnu99` and pass it
with `--platform`.

#### Configuration space

Derive the satisfying configuration space from a feature model in the DIMACS
format (see [here](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html) and
[here](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef/blob/master/FeatureExprLib/src/main/scala/de/fosd/typechef/featureexpr/FeatureModelFactory.scala)):

```
java -jar PCLocator.jar --configure <dimacs_file> <file>:<line>
```

Only features declared in the DIMACS file are considered when deriving
configurations to prevent compiler-specific macros being added to the
configuration. Some DIMACS files are included in the `scripts` directory.

#### Build system

To consider build system information in projects which use Kconfig/Kbuild, you
can use Kmax. PCLocator takes a Kmax `unit_pc` file (including presence
conditions for every directory and file in the project). Have a look at
[kmax-vm](https://github.com/ekuiter/kmax-vm) if you want to generate such a
file. Some files for Busybox and Linux are included in the `scripts` directory.

Run the analysis with

```
java -jar PCLocator.jar --locator kmax --kmaxfile <unit_pc_file> --projectroot <root_directory> <file>:<line>
```

`<root_directory>` should be the directory the entries in the `unit_pc` file
refer to, i.e. the root directory of the analyzed project.

#### Explanation

When analyzing individual lines, add `--explain` to the command line to get an
explanation for how the presence condition for the analyzed line has been
located.

### Analyses

#### Variability Bugs Database

To analyze the VBDB (Abal et. al ASE14), build PCLocator and `cd` into
`scripts/vbdb`.

Use `vbdb_annotate.sh` to produce a file containing presence
conditions and configurations for each file and quickly assess the results.

Use `vbdb.sh` to locate presence conditions and `vbdb_configure.sh` to derive
configurations. Just pass them the location and any additional arguments, e.g.:

```
./vbdb.sh --explain splc18challengecase/vbdb/linux/simple/8c82962.c:58
```

`vbdb_configure.sh` takes as first argument the feature model:

```
./vbdb_configure.sh linux.dimacs splc18challengecase/vbdb/linux/simple/8c82962.c:58
```

Use `vbdb_challenge.sh` to tackle the challenge. It takes as first argument the
program location to analyze (see `locations.txt` for reference), any following
arguments are propagated to PCLocator, e.g.

```
./vbdb_challenge.sh splc18challengecase/vbdb/marlin/simple/2d22902.c:11 --limit 1
```

It will enumerate configurations that include the given program locations and
generate some files in the `challenge` directory: the preprocessed C file, the
compilation result (if any) and a log file containing any errors (a log file for
each configuration and an additional log file containing all errors PCLocator
returned).

Note that by default, like with the `*_configure.sh` scripts, the *entire*
configuration space is enumerated. To sample, say, just one configuration, pass
``--limit 1`` like above. (Or ``--timelimit 1s`` to limit configuration space
deduction to one second. Note that the preprocessing/compilation steps may take
much longer.)

For convenience, `vbdb_challenge_peek.sh` enumerates every location given in the
challenge and analyzes only one configuration using `vbdb_challenge.sh`. It
takes no arguments.

#### BusyBox

To analyze BusyBox, build PCLocator and `cd` into `scripts/busybox`. Use
`busybox.sh` to locate presence conditions and `busybox_configure.sh` to derive
configurations. Just pass them the location and any additional arguments, e.g.:

```
./busybox.sh --parser typechef busybox-1.18.5/modutils/modprobe.c:1
```

With `busybox_compile.sh` you can compile some configuration that includes the
given program location. It takes as first argument the program location to
analyze, any following arguments are propagated to PCLocator, e.g.

```
./busybox_compile.sh busybox-1.18.5/modutils/lsmod.c:50 --parser featurecopp
```

The final binary can be executed with `busybox-1.18.5/busybox`. We have only
tried random samples, so compilation might fail due to libraries missing. This
can be resolved by installing the missing libraries. Also note that using SuperC
or FeatureCoPP (see example) significantly speeds up the process (but may
deliver not as accurate results).

The Kmax files have been generated using
[kmax-vm](https://github.com/ekuiter/kmax-vm). The DIMACS file from the
[TypeChef BusyBox
analysis](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef-BusyboxAnalysis/blob/master/busybox/featureModel.dimacs)
is used.

Note that we analyze BusyBox 1.18.5 here because a feature model was freely
available. For newer versions, check out
[KBuildMiner](https://github.com/ckaestne/KBuildMiner/) to transform KConfig
files to a feature model.

## Manual library setup

Setting up the `lib` folder can be a little involved, because the integrated
tools depend on different versions of the same library.

Here are instructions to reproduce the libraries provided above, if needed:

- Build TypeChef according to its instructions (`sbt assembly`).
- Edit the JAR (e.g., by extracting and re-zipping it) and remove the `xtc` folder.
  This is necessary because the xtc version included by TypeChef is outdated.
- Copy the resulting JAR to `lib/TypeChef.jar`.
- Download xtc (which includes SuperC) and copy the included JAR files
  (`ccl.jar`, `javabdd.jar`, `javacc.jar`, `javancss.jar`, `JFlex.jar`,
  `jhbasic.jar`, `junit.jar`, `rats-runtime.jar`, `rats.jar`, `xtc.jar`) to `lib`.
- From `FeatureCoPP.jar`, extract `choco-solver-4.0.4-with-dependencies.jar` and
  `JCParser.jar` and copy them to `lib`.
